# Libft

This is the first project in the 42 school.
This project have for objective to create some basic functions that we can reuse for future projects.

They are organized in groups. You can check the inlcudes/libft.h for see this organization.

I also added a group of function for parse options in binaries's argument.
This is for complexe option parsing.
You can find all the documentation in Documentation/Opt_parse_arguments.txt

All functions works with Gnu/linux && Mac OSX

This repository is regularly improved.
