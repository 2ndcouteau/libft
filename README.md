# Libft

This project have for objective to create some basic functions that we can reuse for future projects.

They are organized in groups. You can check the inlcudes/libft.h for see this organization.

I also added a group of function for parse options in binaries's argument.
This is for complexe option parsing.
You can find all the documentation in Documentation/Opt_parse_arguments.txt
